# Baran OS

**A distributed runtime for autonomous agent coordination.**

Named after [Paul Baran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baran), pioneer of distributed networks, Baran OS is an event-driven runtime where autonomous agents — AI-powered or not — discover each other, collaborate through typed events, and execute multi-step workflows without ever communicating directly.

## Why Baran

Coordinating multiple autonomous agents is hard. When agents need to collaborate — share results, hand off work, make decisions together — you need infrastructure that handles discovery, routing, sequencing, failure, and state. Building this from scratch for every project is wasteful and error-prone.

Baran OS provides the coordination layer so you can focus on what each agent does, not how they find and talk to each other.

**Core principles:**

- **Agents are external processes** — bring your own language, framework, and logic. Baran only coordinates.
- **All communication flows through the event bus** — no direct agent-to-agent calls. This makes the system observable, auditable, and resilient.
- **Immutable events, stateless agents** — the runtime owns all state. Agents are disposable and horizontally scalable.
- **Typed protocol** — protobuf-defined events with strict payload typing. No stringly-typed chaos.

## Use Cases

Baran OS is designed for scenarios where multiple autonomous agents — with different capabilities, frameworks, and even intelligence models — need to coordinate in real time.

### Emergency Management

Multiple agents collaborate to respond to a crisis: a sensor detects a wildfire, an AI agent estimates risk, a rule-based agent allocates resources, and a human approves the evacuation plan. Each agent contributes its specialty without knowing about the others.

With federation, networks at different levels coordinate hierarchically. A community node detects a wildfire and handles the initial response locally. When the situation exceeds its capacity, it relays a resource request to the provincial node, which has visibility over a wider pool of agents and resources. Each network operates autonomously but can escalate through cross-node event relay.

```

│                 │         │  mutual-aid     │
└─────────────────┘         └─────────────────┘
```

### Autonomous Coding

A coding workflow where AI agents divide the work: a planner breaks down the task, a coder writes the implementation, a reviewer checks for issues, and a tester validates the result. Each agent can use a different LLM or strategy, coordinated as workflow steps with result chaining.

### Agent Swarms

Large-scale agent coordination where dozens of agents with different capabilities register dynamically, discover each other through the capability registry, and self-organize into workflows. Baran's broadcast routing, capability-based discovery, and workflow engine provide the infrastructure swarms need.

### AI Meets Traditional Systems

Baran doesn't require agents to be AI-powered. A workflow can mix LLM-based agents (LangGraph, CrewAI, custom) with rule engines, sensor feeds, legacy services, and human decision points — all speaking the same event protocol. An IoT sensor triggers a workflow, an AI agent analyzes the data, a heuristic agent applies business rules, and a human makes the final call.

```

Agents connect to the runtime, register their capabilities, and receive workflow steps matched to those capabilities. The runtime handles routing, sequencing, state, health monitoring, and failure detection. Agents handle domain logic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22+
- Port 4222 free (embedded NATS)

### Build and run the runtime

```bash
git clone https://github.com/baran-network/baran-os.git
cd baran-os
make build
./baran
```

The runtime starts an embedded NATS server on `:4222` and a health endpoint on `:8080`.

### Run the wildfire example

The [wildfire example](examples/wildfire/) demonstrates three agents collaborating on an emergency response: risk estimation → resource allocation → evacuation planning.

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the runtime
./baran -log-level debug

# Terminal 2-4: Start each agent
go run ./examples/wildfire/agents/risk
go run ./examples/wildfire/agents/resource
go run ./examples/wildfire/agents/evacuation

# Terminal 5: Trigger the workflow
go run ./examples/wildfire/trigger
```

See the [wildfire README](examples/wildfire/README.md) for full details and expected output.

### Build an agent

The Go SDK lets you build an agent in under 20 lines:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "github.com/baran-network/baran-os/sdk"
)

func main() {
    agent := sdk.New("my-agent", "analyzer", "1.0.0")

    agent.Handle(sdk.Capability{
        Name:    "analyze-data",
        Version: "1.0.0",
    }, func(ctx context.Context, step *sdk.StepContext) ([]byte, error) {
        // Your logic here — call an LLM, run heuristics, read sensors
        return []byte(`{"result": "analysis complete"}`), nil
    })

    agent.Run(context.Background())
}
```

The SDK handles connection, registration, capability announcement, health pings, step dispatch, idempotency, and graceful shutdown.

### SDKs

| Language   | Status      |
|------------|-------------|
| Go         | Available   |
| Python     | Planned     |
| TypeScript | Planned     |

The protocol is protobuf over NATS — any language with a NATS client and protobuf support can implement an SDK.
